# The Backrooms

## Normal Levels List

### Level 0 

Level 0 is a non-linear space, resembling the back rooms of a retail outlet. Similar to its previous form, all rooms in Level 0 appear uniform and share superficial features such as yellowed wallpaper, damp carpet, and inconsistently placed fluorescent lighting. However, no two rooms within the Level are identical.

The installed lighting flickers inconsistently and hums at a constant frequency. This buzzing is notably louder and more obtrusive than ordinary fluorescent humming, and examination of the fixtures to determine the source has been inconclusive. The substance saturating the carpet cannot be consistently identified. It is not water, nor is it safe to consume.1

Linear space in Level 0 is altered drastically; it is possible to walk in a straight line and return to the starting point, and retracing your steps will result in a different set of rooms appearing than the ones already passed through. Due to this, and the visual similarity between rooms, consistent navigation is extremely difficult. Devices such as compasses and GPS locators fail to function within the Level, and radio communications are distorted and unreliable.

Level 0 is entirely still and devoid of life. Although it is the primary entrance to the Backrooms, contact with other wanderers within the Level has never been reported. Presumably, a great number of people have died before exiting, the most likely causes being dehydration, starvation, and psychological trauma due to sensory deprivation and isolation. However, no corpses have been reported from these hypothetical deaths. Attempting to enter Level 0 in a group will result in the separation of the group until the Level is exited.

Hallucinations are common in Level 0, the most common being:
- Humming from the lighting increasing to a deafening volume, then abruptly silencing.
- The appearance of doors.
- The appearance of stairs.
- Acute déjà vu.
- Human-like speech resembling no known language.
- Movement in peripheral vision resembling insects crawling underneath the wallpaper, which disappears once the wall is observed directly.
- Insect-like chittering.
- According to analysis, the CO2 levels within Level 0 are rising at a steady rate. The significance of this is unknown.

#### Entities:
No Entities are known to exist within the Level, including other humans. If you see, hear, or encounter what you believe to be another wanderer, it is not a human.

#### Entrances And Exits:
##### Entrances
Accidental no-clipping out of the bounds of reality is the most consistent way of accessing Level 0, and, by extension, The Backrooms. See the 'Basics of the Backrooms' guide for more information.

The Fortresses of Level 283 rarely contain wooden doors that smell of mould; entering these doors will lead to Level 0.

##### Exits
Exiting Level 0 is only possible by no-clipping, which will always result in entry to Level 1. As newcomers to Level 0 are often unfamiliar with the mechanics of the Backrooms, it is necessary to keep your bearings and adapt quickly to the environment to exit.

Entrance to the Manila Room is rare but possible by walking a great distance in any direction. Unlike Level 0, wanderers can meet freely in the Manila Room, but the room is a dead end. Rather, it functions as a rendezvous room for wanderers who survive the trek.

Additionally, documentation from The M.E.G. can be found in the Manila Room, assisting newcomers in survival and escape. Instructions on how to no-clip can be found in [DATA MISSING]
 






### Level 1

Level 1 is a large, sprawling warehouse that features concrete floors and walls, exposed rebar, and a low-hanging fog with no discernable source. The fog often coalesces into condensation, forming puddles on the floor in inconsistent areas. Unlike Level 0, this Level possesses a consistent supply of water and electricity, which allows indefinite habitation by wanderers providing that appropriate precautions are taken. It is also far more expansive, possessing staircases, elevators, isolated rooms, and hallways.

Crates of supplies appear and disappear randomly within the Level, often containing a mixture of vital items (food, Almond Water, batteries, tarps, weaponry, clothing, medical supplies) and nonsensical objects (assorted car parts, boxes of crayons, used syringes, partially burned paper, live mice, mice in a catatonic state that have been injected with unknown substances, shoelaces, loose change, bundles of human hair). The crates should be approached with caution due to their contents, but are a valuable resource.

In addition, crude paintings and drawings with no apparent origin or meaning appear on the walls and floors. They are known to change in appearance and disappear when not in direct line of sight or when unlit. The light fixtures within Level 1 are prone to flicker and fail at inconsistent intervals; when this occurs, supplies are liable to vanish inexplicably and hostile entities may appear unexpectedly. These entities rarely attack in groups, and tend to avoid light and large gatherings of people. It is advised to carry a reliable light source and sleep holding whatever items you do not wish to lose.

Level 1 is home to The Hub.

#### Bases, Outposts and Communities
##### M.E.G. (Major Explorer Group) Base Alpha:
- This is the first main base of the M.E.G.
- About half of the group's Teams live here, mainly housing explorers and supply outposts shared with the B.N.T.G.
- The base is close to one of the entrances of Level 1.
- Heavily guarded against threats such as entity attacks.

##### B.N.T.G. Trader's Keep:
- Trader's Keep is a large city-like complex.
- Around 412 inhabitants, non-hostile.
- Possesses rudimentary societal infrastructure.
- A main supply hub for wanderers.
- Trader's Vault is set up in the Storage Hall in Level 1.
- Keeps communications and friendly relations with The M.E.G.

##### Tom's Diner:
- Run by Tom, a former chef before noclipping into The Backrooms.
- Has plenty of food in storage, resupplied by the B.N.T.G. every few months.
- Tom is an amiable and optimistic person, and his diner serves as a small social hub.

#### Entrances And Exits:
##### Entrances
Get here from Level 0 by noclipping. This Level has many entrances; opening ordinary doors in many Levels has a good chance of leading to Level 1. Additionally, climbing one of the trees in Level 11.1, the end of the fifth event in Level 92, and completing The King's trial in Level 94 are all reliable ways of returning to Level 1.

##### Exits
You can leave Level 1 by simply continuing to explore the Backrooms. Wandering down any extended hallway often leads to Level 2. Finding holes in the wall will lead you to Level 19. Where the ceiling has paintings on it, noclip through and you will be at a party!
