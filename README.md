# The Backrooms

<br>

## Normal Levels List

<br>

### Level 0 

Level 0 is a non-linear space, resembling the back rooms of a retail outlet. Similar to its previous form, all rooms in Level 0 appear uniform and share superficial features such as yellowed wallpaper, damp carpet, and inconsistently placed fluorescent lighting. However, no two rooms within the Level are identical.

The installed lighting flickers inconsistently and hums at a constant frequency. This buzzing is notably louder and more obtrusive than ordinary fluorescent humming, and examination of the fixtures to determine the source has been inconclusive. The substance saturating the carpet cannot be consistently identified. It is not water, nor is it safe to consume.1

Linear space in Level 0 is altered drastically; it is possible to walk in a straight line and return to the starting point, and retracing your steps will result in a different set of rooms appearing than the ones already passed through. Due to this, and the visual similarity between rooms, consistent navigation is extremely difficult. Devices such as compasses and GPS locators fail to function within the Level, and radio communications are distorted and unreliable.

Level 0 is entirely still and devoid of life. Although it is the primary entrance to the Backrooms, contact with other wanderers within the Level has never been reported. Presumably, a great number of people have died before exiting, the most likely causes being dehydration, starvation, and psychological trauma due to sensory deprivation and isolation. However, no corpses have been reported from these hypothetical deaths. Attempting to enter Level 0 in a group will result in the separation of the group until the Level is exited.

Hallucinations are common in Level 0, the most common being:
- Humming from the lighting increasing to a deafening volume, then abruptly silencing.
- The appearance of doors.
- The appearance of stairs.
- Acute déjà vu.
- Human-like speech resembling no known language.
- Movement in peripheral vision resembling insects crawling underneath the wallpaper, which disappears once the wall is observed directly.
- Insect-like chittering.
- According to analysis, the CO2 levels within Level 0 are rising at a steady rate. The significance of this is unknown.

#### Entities:
No Entities are known to exist within the Level, including other humans. If you see, hear, or encounter what you believe to be another wanderer, it is not a human.

#### Entrances And Exits:
##### Entrances
Accidental no-clipping out of the bounds of reality is the most consistent way of accessing Level 0, and, by extension, The Backrooms. See the 'Basics of the Backrooms' guide for more information.

The Fortresses of Level 283 rarely contain wooden doors that smell of mould; entering these doors will lead to Level 0.

##### Exits
Exiting Level 0 is only possible by no-clipping, which will always result in entry to Level 1. As newcomers to Level 0 are often unfamiliar with the mechanics of the Backrooms, it is necessary to keep your bearings and adapt quickly to the environment to exit.

Entrance to the Manila Room is rare but possible by walking a great distance in any direction. Unlike Level 0, wanderers can meet freely in the Manila Room, but the room is a dead end. Rather, it functions as a rendezvous room for wanderers who survive the trek.

Additionally, documentation from The M.E.G. can be found in the Manila Room, assisting newcomers in survival and escape. Instructions on how to no-clip can be found in [DATA MISSING]

### Level 1

Level 1 is a large, sprawling warehouse that features concrete floors and walls, exposed rebar, and a low-hanging fog with no discernable source. The fog often coalesces into condensation, forming puddles on the floor in inconsistent areas. Unlike Level 0, this Level possesses a consistent supply of water and electricity, which allows indefinite habitation by wanderers providing that appropriate precautions are taken. It is also far more expansive, possessing staircases, elevators, isolated rooms, and hallways.

Crates of supplies appear and disappear randomly within the Level, often containing a mixture of vital items (food, Almond Water, batteries, tarps, weaponry, clothing, medical supplies) and nonsensical objects (assorted car parts, boxes of crayons, used syringes, partially burned paper, live mice, mice in a catatonic state that have been injected with unknown substances, shoelaces, loose change, bundles of human hair). The crates should be approached with caution due to their contents, but are a valuable resource.

In addition, crude paintings and drawings with no apparent origin or meaning appear on the walls and floors. They are known to change in appearance and disappear when not in direct line of sight or when unlit. The light fixtures within Level 1 are prone to flicker and fail at inconsistent intervals; when this occurs, supplies are liable to vanish inexplicably and hostile entities may appear unexpectedly. These entities rarely attack in groups, and tend to avoid light and large gatherings of people. It is advised to carry a reliable light source and sleep holding whatever items you do not wish to lose.

Level 1 is home to The Hub.

#### Bases, Outposts and Communities
##### M.E.G. (Major Explorer Group) Base Alpha:
- This is the first main base of the M.E.G.
- About half of the group's Teams live here, mainly housing explorers and supply outposts shared with the B.N.T.G.
- The base is close to one of the entrances of Level 1.
- Heavily guarded against threats such as entity attacks.

##### B.N.T.G. Trader's Keep:
- Trader's Keep is a large city-like complex.
- Around 412 inhabitants, non-hostile.
- Possesses rudimentary societal infrastructure.
- A main supply hub for wanderers.
- Trader's Vault is set up in the Storage Hall in Level 1.
- Keeps communications and friendly relations with The M.E.G.

##### Tom's Diner:
- Run by Tom, a former chef before noclipping into The Backrooms.
- Has plenty of food in storage, resupplied by the B.N.T.G. every few months.
- Tom is an amiable and optimistic person, and his diner serves as a small social hub.

#### Entrances And Exits:
##### Entrances
Get here from Level 0 by noclipping. This Level has many entrances; opening ordinary doors in many Levels has a good chance of leading to Level 1. Additionally, climbing one of the trees in Level 11.1, the end of the fifth event in Level 92, and completing The King's trial in Level 94 are all reliable ways of returning to Level 1.

##### Exits
You can leave Level 1 by simply continuing to explore the Backrooms. Wandering down any extended hallway often leads to Level 2. Finding holes in the wall will lead you to Level 19. Where the ceiling has paintings on it, noclip through and you will be at a party!

### Level 2 
Level 2 consists of mainly of dark, grey, concrete maintenance tunnels, stretching on for millions of miles. The walls are lined with pipes and occasionally ventilation ducts, which often contain a thick viscous black liquid. Doors can sometimes be found, but most are locked or lead into dead ends. These rooms typically house shelves with random assortments of objects, occasionally computers.

At certain parts in hallways in Level 2, the heat can become unbearable, reaching 43 °C (110 °F) or higher. This is usually in areas where the machinery is the loudest, typically at the ends of hallways.

The Entities found on this Level are some of the most dangerous in The Backrooms. Noises can be heard from the vents, which are caused by Crawlers. You can also find Mark in employee bathrooms on Level 2. Other beings here include Smilers, Child Facelings, Clumps, Hounds, Male Deathmoths, Wretches, Bursters, and Skin-Stealers. The only thing you need to know, and can know, is to run away the moment you see one. The Entity shown in the picture above has not been identified, and the fate of the original photographer is unknown.

#### Bases, Outposts and Communities
##### The Survivors:
- A group of about 29 people who explore the Level. Their leader is named Austin, and they are friendly and open to trading. They hold their supplies in wooden crates found in Level 1. They were the first to discover the Wretch. This group often has conflicts with the Followers of Jerry outpost.

##### Office Space EL3A
- Office Space EL3A is an office space in Level 2 home to around 30 members of the B.N.T.G.
For more info, see: Office Space EL3A

#### Entrances And Exits:
##### Entrances
Level 2 is one of the only Levels in the Backrooms that can be directly accessed from normal reality. You can come across Level 2 by exploring for long enough in Level 1. It can also be accessed from The Hub.

##### Exits
Contrary to popular belief, not all of the doors on Level 2 are locked, or lead to dead ends. Some can lead into Level 3, Level 4, and occasionally back to Level 1. Finding a comically proportioned multi-colored door that's unlocked will lead to Level 283. If you no-clip into an extremely hot area in Level 2, you can wind up in Level 2.1.

### Level 3
Level 3 is a series of long, dark, twisting hallways which work similarly to Level 0. They all consist of randomly segmented rooms, which form in no particular pattern, and are extremely loud with the noises of machinery. The hallways are very narrow and enclosed, some even requiring wanderers of average height and build to bend, hunch, crawl, or walk sideways through them.

The walls are comprised of dusty, brown bricks, usually covered in segments of copper pipes and mechanical components. The floors are made of an even dustier grey-tiled floor, whilst the ceiling is made entirely from metal.

Level 3 is one of the larger levels of the Backrooms. Estimated at around 350 million square miles in area (~563 million square kilometers), this presumed size makes sightings of fellow wanderers scarce when traveling through Level 3. It is recommended that you enter Level 3 only if you are properly prepared to defend yourself from anything lurking in the hallways with you, as it is highly unlikely that any aid will come to you should you need it.

As mentioned, Level 0 and Level 3 share some similarities. The rooms are of similar size and layout, and the hallways of both are long and winding. However, the levels also contain some striking differences. One such example would pertain to the rooms of Level 3 themselves, which sometimes contain objects inside of them which help differentiate them from other rooms, something which Level 0 lacks. One of the more notable examples of this is that of a set of rusty prison bars, captured in image form by The M.E.G. in the initial exploration of the level in 2012 (see the image attached to the right for reference regarding the appearance of the bars). Further tests have demonstrated that no matter what methods were attempted, bars could never be removed or opened, nor the walls around them.1 Such obstructions have made it impossible to traverse certain portions of Level 3, so the level cannot be fully mapped at present.

M.E.G. field explorers have reported that areas where prison bars are more numerous tend to instill a heightened sense of fear and extreme discomfort in wanderers. Wanderers often claim to feel as if they are being watched, and have even claimed to see strange figures lurking beyond the bars. The M.E.G. has concluded that such phenomena are either the result of hallucinations, or merely rumors.

Level 3 shares many similarities with Level 2, such as the fact that walls are typically lined with pipes. The pipes are far less abundant than those of Level 2, but can still be found lining the corners of most hallways. The echo of the viscous, black sludge that flows through these pipes is one of the main sources of noise within the level. The sludge in question is highly toxic and emits deadly fumes that cause damage to the body’s nervous system if inhaled, as well as 2nd/3rd degree burns upon direct contact with skin. All studies attempting to analyze the chemical composition of the sludge have yielded inconclusive results. This in itself poses an obstacle to research on the substance’s properties and potential functions.

Out-of-place electrical rooms can also be found randomly throughout the hallways of Level 3. These electrical rooms can vary greatly in every single aspect, but the majority of them are extremely dark and contain a single generator. Electrical or electronic appliances such as breaker boxes, computers, loose wires, security camera monitors, and fluorescent lights have also been reported.

Level 3, while relatively dangerous, is considered a hotspot for supply bases. This is because Level 3 is rich with resources such as Almond Water, False Outlets, Liquid Pain, Firesalt, Royal Rations, Squirt Guns, and Bottled Lightning. Along with the aforementioned items, other objects not native to The Backrooms can be found throughout the level, such as knives, lighters, bolt cutters, flashlights, and other miscellaneous weapons or supplies. Notably, Level 3 is also the level in which Wi-Fi in The Backrooms is at its strongest, sitting at a consistent three or four bars instead of fluctuating randomly like in the majority of other levels.

The abundant machinery within the level causes temperatures within Level 3 to be uncomfortably warm but generally bearable, with the average temperature ranging widely from 66 to 93°F (~18 to 33°C). Long-distance travel across Level 3 is made difficult by regions in which the temperature may rise dramatically to become entirely inhospitable, with the highest temperature ever recorded being 135°F (~57°C)2. Reports also exist of regions with damp, thick air, which makes the air in these areas difficult to breathe.

The machinery of Level 3 is quite possibly the most dangerous aspect of its ambient environment. The machines found throughout the level operate autonomously without the need for external intervention. Wanderers may benefit from useful machinery or tap into the apparently infinite extranormal supply of electricity powering them. However, the autonomy of these machines also makes them hazardously volatile. Machines often break down and require regular maintenance, which is dangerous since their power supply cannot be turned off by any means. Furthermore, the machines have been known to spontaneously combust or explode on several occasions, causing grievous injury to Wanderers unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity. Despite this, the danger of machinery can be easily avoided if one does not act rashly while traversing the level, and instead scouts out a safe route.

#### Entities
Level 3 contains many dangerous entities. It is almost impossible to traverse large distances without encountering them at least once. Hounds, Facelings, Wretches, Male and Female Deathmoths, Skin-Stealers, Dullers, Smilers, Clumps, and Bursters all seem to inhabit this level, preying on anyone unlucky enough to succumb to them. The Crawler Fungus has been found growing here, and the high humidity makes it easy for the Disease to spread here as well, so you are advised to maintain proper hygiene practices while making your way through the tunnels.

Whilst these entities do not appear at every corner, their large numbers have caused countless casualties among wanderer circles and M.E.G. operatives alike. These entities have even been reported to actively seek out hubs of human activity — particularly minor bases —in hopes of dismantling them and feasting on their occupants. Attacks on M.E.G. Base Gamma are frequent, but often pose little to no threat due to the size and defensive capacities of the base in question. Smaller groups, such as the FOJ, have reported difficulty in keeping their outposts intact. Many of them have experienced near or total collapse of their outposts as a result of multiple attacks, and live in constant fear for their safety.

#### Bases, Communities, and Outposts3
Numerous groups have consistently attempted to set up bases in Level 3 in order to make use of its abundant assets. A large proportion of these attempts fail merely days after they are established, as entities can and will attack vulnerable bases that are not prepared for onslaught. The high failure rate should serve as a warning—do not attempt to settle in Level 3 unless you have the resources, manpower and tenacity to do so.

##### M.E.G. - Base Gamma
- Third-most important M.E.G. base.
- Around 300 operatives permanently stationed here, and a large quantity of other lodge here, oftentimes seeking refuge from entities which are contained within the level.
- Originally constructed by M.E.G. operatives out of makeshift bricks which were made of shredded toothbrushes, shoelaces, toy plastic horseshoes, and bottles of glue, all found in level 3 itself. The inhabitants of the base armed themselves makeshift slings which were made of electrical cables and rubber bands bound to bones of some entities they had previously slain. They used capsules of Liquid Pain as ammunition for these slingshots.
- Open to trading.
- Commonly attacked by swarms of entities.
- The most well-powered base in the Backrooms, and is also targeted by humans for that reason.
- Largest documented base on Level 3.
##### B.N.T.G. - Storage Facility
- Used as a primary storage facility for the B.N.T.G.
- A multitude of resources belonging to the B.N.T.G. are stored in it, all prepared for trading in other levels.
- Open to trading, but their trades have been known to be unreasonably high.
- Around 150 permanent members, with the majority of visitors staying in for less than an hour due to the speed at which the B.N.T.G transfers resources between levels.
- 2nd largest documented base on Level 3.
- Followers of Jerry - Blue Salvation
- Only 15 permanent members.
- Set up for the purpose of resource collection.
- Very small in size, and has come under siege and teetered on the edge of destruction multiple times.
- Hostile to those not willing to learn of Jerry.
- Unpredictable threat level.
##### The Masked Maidens - Unknown name
- Unconfirmed base.
- Rumored to exist after frequent attacks on Base Gamma from the Maidens.
- If encountered, avoid at all costs.
##### U.E.C. - Base Scylla
- Unknown amount of members.
- Likely set up to collect resources.
- Not open to trading.
- Should not be approached.
#### Entrances and Exits4
##### Entrances
- Unlocked doors on Level 2 commonly lead to Level 3.
- Elevators on Level 4 and Level 5 can lead back to Level 3.
- Entering bunkers on Level 10 can sometimes lead to Level 3.
- Buildings on Level 11 that have a similar look to Level 3 on the inside can sometimes teleport you to it.
- Rusty pipes found inside Level 13 may lead to Level 3 should you make contact with them.
- The Metro is also an easy way to access Level 3.
##### Exits
